NEURONS

1.	Neurons have cell bodies containing (post-synaptic) receptors that produce an excitatory or inhibitory response in the cell body.
2.	Neurons sum the excitatory and inhibitory responses.
3.	Neurons fire (generate an action potential) if the sum exceeds some threshold value.
4.	Neurons have an axon (an elongated extension of the cell body) that conducts the action potential to all its pre-synaptic terminals (boutons) that then send a neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft to the receptors of all neurons it connects to.


RULES FOR SYNAPTIC MODIFICATION

Consider two neurons, A and B.  The axon of A synapses onto the cell body of B.

1.	Whenever A fires, its synapses on B become eligible for modification.  This period of eligibility lasts for approximately 1 second.
2.	If B fires within the eligibility period, A’s synapses on B are increased in value.  This increase is temporary, with exponential decay (ideally, though usually linear, stepwise) on a time scale of minutes.
3.	If the organism is reinforced (or punished) during the period of temporary increase in synaptic efficacy, decay is halted at that point (“fixed”), creating a new, permanent lower bound.  Subsequent increases in efficacy commence from that point.
4.	A synapse has either a positive (excitatory) or negative (inhibitory) effect on the post-synaptic neuron.  Positive synapses are fixed by positive reinforcement, negative ones by punishment.
