1.  "De-kluge" the present version of the program.  There are many parts of the program that are inelegant at present 
because I have no training as a programmer.  I just invented things that worked.  The primary problem is I knew virtually nothing
of object oriented program as I wrote this.  It would seem that this program would greatly benefit if programmed as objects.
For example a class neuron has properties axons, synapses, etc. It is unclear to me if doing it that way would allow us to sum
inputs and generate "firings" and behaviors more efficiently than doing so through matrix multiplication as it is done now.

2.  Create an expandable API version of the program.  Thus could be added to other systems allowing them to use the learning
capabilities of the program in diverse applications.  For example, a home control system could use it to enable the homeowner
to reward and punish the program so as to teach it to turn on the hall lights when s/he comes home after dark.

3.  Expand the capabilities of the program by adding additional affective responses and associated motivational systems.
